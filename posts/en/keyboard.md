# My Epomaker TH40: The Adventure I Never Knew I Needed

Let’s be honest: I spend more time with my keyboard than with most of my friends. (Sorry, friends. You don’t have RGB backlighting or nice switches.) So when I picked up the Epomaker TH40, I was already in love with its compact 40% layout. But, as any keyboard enthusiast knows, true love means customization. Enter: ceramic keycaps.

## My First 40% Keyboard: Where Are All the Keys?!

Confession time: the TH40 is my very first 40% keyboard. I thought, “How hard could it be? Fewer keys, less to worry about!” Oh, how naïve I was. The first time I sat down to type, I felt like a pianist who’d just discovered half the keys had gone on vacation. Where’s my dedicated number row? Where’s my beloved arrow cluster? Why do I have to hold down three keys just to get a question mark? 

Coding was a whole new level of keyboard gymnastics. I spent the first few days accidentally opening emoji menus, launching mysterious macros, and occasionally locking myself out of my own computer. My muscle memory was in full rebellion—my pinky kept reaching for keys that no longer existed, and my brain was convinced the “Esc” key was playing hide-and-seek.

And then there were the layers—oh, the layers! If you’ve never used a 40% keyboard before, let me tell you: layers are like secret floors in a building, except the elevator buttons are hidden and sometimes upside down. Suddenly, every key is a shape-shifting chameleon, pulling double or triple duty depending on which mysterious “Fn” combo you’re holding. I spent the first week feeling like a hacker in a spy movie, except instead of cracking codes, I was just trying to type a curly brace without accidentally launching Spotify. Getting the right layer at the right time was confusing af, and I’m pretty sure my left pinky developed trust issues from all the accidental key combos.

## Why the Epomaker TH40?

Despite the learning curve (or should I say, learning cliff), the TH40 quickly won me over. Its hot-swappable PCB means I can change switches faster than I change my mind about dinner. Anddd I didn't change the switches. Who knows, maybe there will be a update on that in the future ?

## The Ceramic Keycap Quest

Now, about those ceramic keycaps. I’ll admit, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole. Most people are content with ABS or PBT, but I wanted something that would make my keyboard feel like a work of art and a weapon of mass productivity.

Ceramic keycaps are heavier than plastic—each one feels like a tiny porcelain tile. They’re made by firing clay at high temperatures, which means they’re tough, smooth, and have a unique, almost glassy finish. They’re also naturally cool to the touch, which is a weirdly satisfying sensation when you start typing in the morning.

Finally I decided to go all-in and picked up a set from Cerakey. They're a bit pricey (the whole set cost me more than the board itself), but I was convinced they’d be worth it. I mean, who wouldn’t want to type on something that looks like it belongs in a museum?

## The Typing Experience: ASMR for Your Fingers

Here’s where things get magical. Typing on ceramic keycaps is like playing a tiny xylophone with your fingertips. The sound is a crisp, high-pitched “clack” that’s oddly soothing—think rain on a ceramic roof, but with more productivity. The weight of the keycaps gives each press a satisfying solidity, and the smooth surface makes my fingers glide like Olympic figure skaters.

Technically speaking, the increased mass of the ceramic keycaps slightly dampens the upstroke, making each keystroke feel more deliberate. The thermal properties mean the keys start cool and gradually warm up, which is a fun (and slightly addictive) tactile experience.

## Everyday Use: The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful

After a couple of weeks, I can say the ceramic keycaps are a game-changer. They’re resistant to shine, easy to clean (just don’t drop them on tile floors—trust me), and they make my TH40 look like it belongs in a modern art museum. The only downside? If you’re a furious typist, the sound might be a bit much for open offices or libraries. But hey, that’s just your keyboard’s way of saying, “Look at me, I’m fabulous.”

And yes, I eventually tamed the 40% beast. My fingers have learned the arcane rituals of layer keys and combos. Coding is now a breeze—well, a breeze with occasional gusts of “Wait, how do I get a tilde again?” But the speed is back, and the satisfaction is real.

## Final Thoughts: Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. My Epomaker TH40 with ceramic keycaps is now the crown jewel of my desk. It’s unique, it’s beautiful, and it makes typing feel like a luxury experience. If you’re looking to upgrade your keyboard and don’t mind a little extra weight (and a lot of extra style), ceramic keycaps are worth every penny.
